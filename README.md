# Customer Churn (Threshold Tuning)

## Objective

## Predict customer churn and tune the classification threshold to maximize F1, Precision, and Recall.

## Dataset

## IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset (CSV)

## Steps

1. Data Exploration
2. Preprocessing (encoding, cleaning, scaling)
3. Model training using Logistic Regression
4. Threshold tuning using precision/recall/F1 curves
5. Selecting the optimal threshold
